## SCHD Risk Analysis Dashboard - Project Tasklist

```markdown
* **Crucial Execution Constraint:** We will proceed **one task at a time**. We will **not advance** from a task or sub-task until explicitly instructed by you.
* **Crucial Communication Constraint:**
    * I will listen and review everything you say carefully and follow your instructions to the letter. If I am having problems understanding something or need to know more, I will ask without assuming, jumping ahead, guessing, or estimating. I will follow your exact words.
    * I am not to ask you anything about going forward; you will tell me when to advance. I will focus on the task I am performing and not try to move ahead.
    * All scripts must be labeled with a sequential cell number (e.g., #Cell 1, #Cell 2).

## SCHD Risk Analysis Dashboard Components

* **✅ Step 1: Data Foundation**
    * ✅ Obtain historical adjusted closing prices and dates for SCHD from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
    * ✅ Ensure the data is clean and suitable for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, if any).

* **✅ Step 2: Core Risk Metrics Calculation**
    * ✅ **Calculate Return Analysis**
        * ✅ Price Return calculation (Cell 2)
        * ✅ Total Return with dividends calculation (Cell 3)
    * ✅ **Calculate Volatility Analysis**
        * ✅ Daily and annualized volatility (Cell 4)
        * ✅ Rolling volatility trends (30-day, 90-day)
        * ✅ Return distribution statistics
    * ✅ **Calculate Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics**
        * ✅ Sharpe Ratio calculation (Cell 5)
        * ✅ Beta calculation vs SPY benchmark (Cell 5)
        * ✅ Alpha calculation (Cell 5)
        * ✅ Correlation and R-squared with market (Cell 5)

* **✅ Step 3: Dashboard Visualization and Analysis**
    * ✅ **Create Performance Visualization Charts**
        * ✅ Price and return performance over time
        * ✅ Volatility trends visualization
        * ✅ Risk-return scatter plot vs benchmark
    * ✅ **Generate Risk Assessment Summary**
        * ✅ Risk profile categorization
        * ✅ Performance vs benchmark analysis
        * ✅ Investment suitability assessment

* **✅ Step 4: Future Value Projections**
    * ✅ **Monte Carlo Simulation & Scenario Analysis** (Cell 8)
        * ✅ Projected future portfolio values for Lump Sum and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA).
        * ✅ Calculated probability distributions for different investment scenarios (5, 10, 20 years).
        * ✅ Created comparison charts for DCA vs. Lump Sum strategies.

* **✅ Step 5: Final Report Generation**
    * ✅ Consolidate all analyses and visualizations into a single, comprehensive PDF report.
    * ✅ Add an executive summary and concluding remarks.

* **✅ Step 6: Code Refactoring & Cleanup**
    * ✅ Refactor the notebook to improve code structure, remove redundancies, and add more detailed comments.
    * ✅ Ensure all cells run sequentially without errors.

***

**Status Update:**
**What We Need to Do Next:**
* All project tasks have been completed successfully. The SCHD Risk Analysis Dashboard is now fully implemented and ready for use.

**Cell Numbering:**
* All analysis cells (1-8) are complete.
* ✅ Cell 9: Report Generation (Completed)
* ✅ Cell 10: Code Refactoring Notes (Completed)

Remember I am working in a JupyterNotebook in VSCode on a windows pc so I will need the code for answers
